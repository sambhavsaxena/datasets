# US Car Accidents Analysis
This notebook aims to analyze the data of US road accidents from 2016 to 2020.
The data has been sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).  


# Some inferences :  
- A high percentage of accidents occur between 0600 hrs - 0900 hrs. The reason behind this could be because people commute for work and hence high traffic.
- The accidents peak again at around 1500 hrs - 1800 hrs. This could again be due to people commuting back home from work.  
- On weekends, the number of accidents decreases.  
- The accidents start to increase as the year ends.  
This could be due to the festive season towards the end of the year due to which the number of commuters increase.
- The data for 2016 is not complete, it is a little unreliable.
